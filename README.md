# About

If you use the same password for more than one web site and any one of them is hacked, you run the risk that someone will be able to use your password to break into your accounts on other sites. For that reason, you should always use a different password for every account and web site you use.

BearPass is a password manager that helps you secure and organize your passwords by using the most advanced and secure encryption alogorithms (Rijndael/AES) to encryp your passwords informartion. So no need to remember all those zillions of passwords for each and every website. BearPass is an OFFLINE password manager so you can have complete control of your passwords. It also comes with a random password generator to generate unique and strong passwords.
